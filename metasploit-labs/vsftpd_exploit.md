> This one is a classic. In 2011, a backdoored version of VSFTPD 2.3.4 slipped into the wild. Hackers embedded a malicious payload triggered by a smiley face :) in the username field. 
> Metasploit added this exploit, making it an iconic example of how subtle vulnerabilities could lead to full-blown compromise.
