# cybersecurity-journey

### This repository documents my hands-on learning and projects as I transition into a career in cybersecurity. Here youâ€™ll find labs, scripts, notes, and reflections as I work through certifications, courses, and real-world challenges.

#### Very vague, very mysterious. Here are some more specific goals I hope to accomplish here:
1. Build confidence with tools like `metasploit` and `nmap`
2. Amass a collection Python scripts for automation....not for my job or anything, I swear.
3. Document my processes for dealing with real-world security challenges as they become more intentional and streamlined. Experience, amirite?
